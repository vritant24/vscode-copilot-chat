- The results returned from these recent tool calls (truncate if very long but preserve key information)
- What the agent was actively working on when the token budget was exceeded
- How these recent operations connect to the overall user goals
Include all important tool calls and their results as part of the appropriate sections, with special emphasis on the most recent operations.
